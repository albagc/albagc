- 👋 Hi, I’m @albagc
- 👩‍💻 I’m a biomedical engineer focused on data science research and modelling applied to biomedical problems.
- ✍ I’m currently writing my thesis as an statistics PhD candidate, mainly about the use of latent variable based models (typical in industry or in chemometrics) to several biomedical engineering real problems. But I'm also working with black box/non-linear models.
- 🔥 I’m looking to collaborate on future research projects/companies related to mathematical or data science applications in biomedical fields. 
- 🖖 Reach me via e-mail (albagoncebrian@gmail.com; algonceb@upv.es) or also via LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/alba-gonzález-cebrián-67bab010b/) or Research Gate (https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alba-Gonzalez-Cebrian).
